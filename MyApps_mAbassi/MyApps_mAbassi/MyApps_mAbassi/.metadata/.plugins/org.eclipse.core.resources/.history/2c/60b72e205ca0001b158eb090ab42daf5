 * user callback is registered and used.
 * 
 * The above functions will return an ALT_AVALON_I2C_BUSY status if the ip is already enabled,

 * are complete START to STOP sequence commands to simplify typical write and read operations and are
 * basically wrappers for the alt_avalon_i2c_master_transmit() and alt_avalon_i2c_master_receive() functions.
